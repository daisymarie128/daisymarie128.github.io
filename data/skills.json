At the time I was very new to creative coding and had very little experience with JS or programming in general. After being in a meeting and hearing Nicc's idea I was puzzled at how it was even possible. However after 30minutes of planning and deconstructing the problem I had a plan on how to make it and after a few hours of reading up on Angular I had a working prototype. I'm proud of this experiment because I saw how simple a complex problem could be, this experiment was built using just CSS and Angular.",
