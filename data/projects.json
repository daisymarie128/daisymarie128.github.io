First off though a brand and theme had to be chosen and after a numerous amount of thinking, designing and re-thinking the team had decided on â€˜Specimenâ€™ as our theme. It was now time to get down to the nitty gritty and start designing off this theme which was great. It alowed me to explore new programs and develop my digital skills. I played a makor role in the digital team creating animations which were used for pod projections, video elements on the website, promo teasers for the event and also used for promotional posters.
